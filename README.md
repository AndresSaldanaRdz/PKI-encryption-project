In the current context, the distribution of energy for public use is no longer efficient due to its centralized nature, which does not allow for the implementation of renewable energy sources. Therefore, the implementation of LiCore's SMART devices is sought to monitor the energy consumption of a particular place that has sustainable energy generators. Depending on the energy demand and availability, this energy can be regulated to optimize the resources. LiCore is a company that aims to revolutionize the way we manage energy in our homes and believes in a green future where renewable energy is abundant. One of the accessible renewable energy sources for households is solar panels, and LiCore is working on a kind of meter that monitors the energy generated in the home and decides whether to store, use, or distribute it intelligently. The challenge in this situation is the risk of information integrity, and LiCore requires the implementation of meters that guarantee confidentiality, integrity, and authenticity of the data collected. The meters need to be able to transmit information through the internet without it losing their privacy and integrity.
